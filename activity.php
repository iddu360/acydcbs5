              Ministry is a sole pillar of Awindiri CYDC as we believe the
              spiritual aspect of life forms the basis on which all the other
              aspects of life stand upon.To achieve this mission, we indulge
              in various outreaches through Crusades, home visits, and also
              weekly devotions at center days!Indeed the presence of the Lord
              is so wholesome and worth being in!
